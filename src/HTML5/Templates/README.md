# AstroFields HTML5 library

Currently there are classes for the following types:

`color`, `email`, `number`, `range`, `tel` and `url`

## Future Versions

The types of `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime` and `datetime-local` are
not that easy. Date and time are extremely different from region to region, country
to country, etc. these types need a deep thought before starting on it.

They will also need accompanying Receivers and Commands to Sanitize their passed values.

If you want to take a try, just go for it and send a _Pull Request_ to start the discussion.
